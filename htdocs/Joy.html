			<p>This doll is Abe. Backward for Eba, the first female on Earth. 
			Her spirit represents the female sex and haunts those who continuously plant ignorance into themselves and others. 
			Her appearance might seem terrifying at a glance, but that's how people perceive her. 
			They think she's a monster that threatens to destroy the lives of those in power. However, her purpose is far from that. 
			She only wants to spread happiness and strength to every living woman in the world. 
			And maybe when the world disappears, she can leave knowing she accomplished her goal.</p>

		An example would be, "Puhon ikaw pud" which translates to "Someday, you will too." Learn more <a href="https://www.theweekendwarriorph.com/2021/07/22/puhon-a-visayan-word/">here.</a></h6>
