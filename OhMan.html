		<h3>Oh Man!</h3>
		<p id="part1">People use this phrase when something happens that does not, perhaps, meet their expectations.
		And it's funny that this phrase can apply to actual men! Now, people might think, "As if men don't experience harassment either,"
		"You're just finding a reason to hate on men," "You don't have to be so emotional," and so many more unwanted opinions. 
		But the real side we should examine is, are women causing their pain? 
		Is it their fault for people choosing to do inhumane actions onto them? Let's look at what the data says.</p>
	
		<p id="data1">According to the UN WOMEN organization, about 1 in 3 women have experienced sexual violence either with a partner or not. 
		These women also have higher chances of having mental health problems caused by the inflicted pain. 
		Well, the 1:3 ratio does not include women who have dealt with sexual harassment. 
		If that were true, it would probably be 1 in 2 or worse, <em>every single one of them</em>.</p>
	
		<p id="data2">Also, only less than 40% of women choose to seek professional help. "But the government is also doing their part to help women, so what insufficient efforts are you talking about?" 
		Yes, that's true. An estimated 155 countries passed laws tackling domestic violence, while 140 countries specified laws regarding workplace sexual harassment. 
		Our country, the Republic of the Philippines, is included in both mentioned statistics. Nothing wrong, right? Everything's fine until the certainty of people following it is non-existent. Really, oh man.</p>
		
		<p id="part2">"But not all men are like that. I haven't done that to any of the female members of my family. 
		How is that dangerous?" *deep sigh* Well, let's put it this way. Your pet dog accidentally bit you. Unless s/he has received the vaccine, s/he has the potential to infect you with a deadly disease. 
		Being as human as ever, you immediately seek help from a doctor to get vaccinated as well. Hooray to lesser chances of being sick! 
		After a few months, you start to recover. As you get out of the hospital, a therapy dog suddenly walks in front of you to approach a patient behind you. 
		Won't you feel scared to be infected again (because you don't know that he's a therapy dog) by seeing another dog in front of you?</p>
		
		<p id="last">It doesn't take 100 brain cells to understand what's happening. Yes, not all men are abusive, disgusting, and have trashy personalities. 
		Thanks for not being one of them. Sure, you're part of the men that have willfully respected your female counterparts. 
		So what? Not harming women does not erase the fact that all women still face violence. 
		Instead, ask yourself: will all men choose to hold their peers accountable for their shameless acts? 
		Because if you choose to answer yes, then oh man, may you exceed God's expectations.</p>
